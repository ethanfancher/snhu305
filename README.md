1. The client was Artemis Financial, a financial institution seeking to enhance the security of their existing application. They wanted to address potential security vulnerabilities in their software.

2. I was able to effectively identify security vulnerabilities in the code through static testing. It's crucial to code securely because it protects both the company and its users from personal information and trade secret loss. Secure software also helps safeguard a company's reputation in the long run.

3. The most challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was checking each dependency by hand for vulnerabilities. The most helpful tool was the dependency check tool, which helped identify potential vulnerabilities more efficiently.

4. To increase security layers, I focused on updating old libraries used in the code. In the future, I would employ penetration testing to further assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques.

5. I ensured the code and software application were functional and secure through continuous debugging during the coding process. After refactoring the code, I conducted another vulnerability test to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

6. Stack Overflow was a helpful resource to consult when running into errors in the console. I also employed a hash function to send encrypted communications, which could showcase my skills to a future employer.
